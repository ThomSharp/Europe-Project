      Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is known for its rich history, diverse cultures, and influential role in global politics, economics, and art. Europe is made up of about 44 countries, each with its own languages, traditions, and governments, ranging from small nations like Luxembourg to large ones like Russia. The continent features a mix of landscapes, including mountains, plains, rivers, and coastlines, and has been the birthplace of major historical events, scientific advancements, and cultural movements that have shaped the modern world.
