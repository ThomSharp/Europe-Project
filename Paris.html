<h3>History of Paris</h3>

<h3>Important Historical Events</h3>

Paris was hit hard by the Black Death and later suffered during the Hundred Years War. In 1572 the St. Bartholomew’s day Massacre saw thousands of Protestants killed. The city played a key role in the French revolution, beginning with the storming of the Bastille in 1789. In the 1800s Napoleon reshaped Paris with major building projects and later Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann rebuilt the city’s layout, creating the wide boulevards seen today. Paris was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940 but liberated in 1944. Modern events include the students protest of May 1968 and the terrorist attacks of 2015. </p>
