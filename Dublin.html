  <h3>Important Historical Events</h3>
  <p>In the 19th century, Ireland experienced revolutionary struggles. Movements for self-determination grew, leading to events like the 1916 Rising, the 1919 War of Independence, the 1922 Anglo-Irish Treaty, and the following Civil War.

  <h3>How the City Grew Over Time</h3>
  <p>After independence, Dublin became the capital of the new state. Schools, public buildings, and housing were built, and the city slowly expanded. During the Celtic Tiger (1995–2008), Dublin transformed into a major tech and finance hub, attracting companies like Google, Microsoft, Intel, Facebook, and Amazon. Today, Dublin has a population of 1.5 million and a high GDP per capita.</p>
