<h2>About us
</h2>
<p>For this website I decided to focus on three well known European cites Dublin, London, Paris because each city has a rich history and there all unique in their own ways and each city has great culture and interesting landmarks. </p>
<p>The purpose of this website is to give a brief overview of how each city has changed over time and to highlight some of each city most important historical events and explore what makes each city special today.</p> 
<p>I chose these cites because I find them very interesting and I wanted to learn more about their past and present. This website is designed to be easy to read and informative for anyone who wants to learn something about some of Europe’s most important cites.</p>
